I didn't get much sleep last night, in anticipation of rejoining Eeby and our imminent travels.
## Packing
Packing felt like it went well, but I have managed to misplace a few items - the head of my Magic Wand, the panties that match my black striped bra and... my prescriptions. More on that later.
## Cleaners
Anna's NDIS cleaner arrived at Anna's at 10:30am. I had a great time helping as much as I could and chatting. She was even so kind as to drive me down to the train station! It was validating for her to be questioning of why I didn't qualify for the NDIS due to my limitations. I, too, am at the same loss.
## Station and Subway
I was dropped off, I booked my luggage through and I promptly went and had an Italian BMT. Yum.

The train was about half an hour late, possibly due to a derailment due to an accident between a truck and a three engine grain transport at a level grossing at Old Junee earlier in the morning. It wasn't a bother to have to wait.

## Train
Ticket-lady noticed that I had a laptop and upgraded me to a front seat with a larger table. She rocked. Train trip was spent writing while struggling against the jarring movement of the train, at this point in this project I'll take any opportunity to catch up on writing, re-writing and new development with Hugo and Asocial.

## Eeby
Met Eeby at Albury, did the smiling and feeling good to be in each others company, got some groceries, got home, chatted with Eeby and Fiona, had Fish & Chips for dinner and had phantom pain flare up high, due to a stumble earlier in the day and a lack of Amitriptyline. Sigh, we'll have to drop into Wagga on Friday's travels.
