Today was a nice quiet day compared to the handful of days I've experienced recently. I feel good about having Francine blocked, and pretty stable with regards to David having passed away.
## Ruby and the FetLife Wagga group
Ruby messaged me, and I love when she does for social reasons. Turns out that Sam had cheated on her, I had no idea that they weren't polyamorous. She wants to take a break from Fet, which is probably a wise idea, and has asked me to temporarily become an admin for the Wagga group. I have no idea if this will involve organising munches, and taking a role like this is something that I consider to be unwise, but Ruby has been there for me in the past. She has my support.
