Eeby and I awoke in Leeton, me hours before her, but that was OK. I had to relieve my own horniness (I know, right? How privileged I am to even need to mention such an imposition!) I made myself a rather excellent ham and cheese toastie, and resolved to make one for Eeby upon her awakening. Oh, and tea too.

We called into the Wagga Mardi Gras' Hangover Market on the way home. Ran into Allen and made a cheeky comment in lieu of a hello, got some food swag courtesy of Coles, bought a pair of wooden trans pride earrings, ran into Kelly (with hubby and kids) and whats-her-name starting with V from the munches. I think I should contact Ruby and see what the situation is regarding Munches.

Upon arriving home, we were exhausted, Fiona had a vey sore sholder and Eeby had an anxious second wind of wanting to get household tasks done. I wanted to catch up on writing, but did not achieve much in that regard.
