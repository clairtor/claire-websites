I wanted this to be a quiet, uneventful day, free from strenuous physical activity as well as a chance to process and continue moving through the stages of grief over David's death... but unfortunately, It was not to be.

I had to call Mental Health services on Francine.

We are done as friends.

I will flesh this out in due time. I need to process this.
