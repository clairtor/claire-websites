Today started as a quiet day of rest and catching up on writing, but alas, it was not to be. Eeby and I visited the Wodonga Vinnie's Op Shop and the nearby Kmart & Coles. I didn't get the writing I wanted done, I pfaffed about playing with typography and colour schemes... and then Mum called.

## Bloomfield Reunion
So, apparently a Bloomfield Reunion is happening at Easter, and Rhiannan will be staying at Mum & Dads, leading Mum to suggest that Eeby and I stay at the Darlington Point Caravan Park.
Why does she assume that Eeby will be with me? Why does she think that I'd be happy being kept at arms length like familial detritus? I will not let myself be treated like that, either have me or don't. It would be different if the reason was logistical in nature, but no, this is all driven by hatred and I refuse to dance for it.
I am especially fed up with being unable to engage Mum in any discussion surrounding feelings. She shuts down everything defensively, and so nothing can ever improve or resolve. Fucking hell I despise ignorance. Disagreement is far more agreeable.

## Eeby
Eeby was a great support after the call. We hugged, her kneeling before my couch-seated self before inviting me to hunt 'spoods'. Later on we watched all of Castlevania season 3.
I love that girl.
